    <div class="text">And in the best
        of all possible lives, 
        that beginning and that 
        end are the same: in poem 
        after poem I encountered 
        words that mark the first 
        something made out of 
        language that we hear 
        as children repeated night 
        after night, like a refrain: 
        I love you. I am here with you. 
        Don't be afraid. 
        Go to sleep now. 
        And I encountered words that 
        mark the last something made 
        out of language that we hope 
        to hear on earth: 
        I love you. I am here with you. 
        Don't be afraid. 
        Go to sleep now.</div>
