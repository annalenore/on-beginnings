    <div class="text">When I told Mr. Angel about the lifelong sentence, 
        he said: “That's a lot of semicolons!” he is absolutely right; 
        the sentence would be unwieldy and awkward and resemble 
        the novel of a savant, but the next time you use a semicolon 
        (which, by the way, is the least-used mark of punctuation 
        in all of poetry) you should stop and be thankful 
        that there exists this little thing, invented by a human 
        being—an Italian as a matter of fact—that allows us to 
        go on and keep on connecting speech that for 
        all apparent purposes is unrelated.</div>
