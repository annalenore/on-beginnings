    <div class="text">But there is no book I know 
        of on the subject of how poems begin. 
        How can the origin be <a href=similar-text.html>traced</a> when 
        there is no form or shape that precedes 
        it to trace? It is exactly like tracing 
        the moment of the big bang—we can go back 
        to a nanosecond before the beginning, 
        before the universe burst into being, 
        but we can't go back to the precise beginning 
        because that would precede knowledge, 
        and we can't “know” anything before 
        “knowing” itself was born.</div>
