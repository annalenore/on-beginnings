    <div class="text">Gaston Bachelard says 
        the single most succinct
        and astonishing thing: 
        We begin in admiration 
        and we end by organizing 
        our disappointment. 
        The moment of admiration 
        is the experience of something 
        unfiltered, 
        vital and fresh—it could 
        also be horror—and the moment 
        of organization is both the 
        onset of disappointment and 
        its dignification; the least 
        we can do is dignify our knowingness, 
        the loss of some vitality through familiarization, 
        by admiring not the thing itself but how we can organize it, 
        think about it.</div>
