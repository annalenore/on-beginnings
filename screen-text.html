    <div class="text">I have never, in my life, 
        read a poem that ended with 
        the words The End. 
        Why is that, I wonder. 
        I think perhaps the brevity 
        of poems compared to novels 
        makes one feel that there has 
        been no great sustention of energy, 
        no marathon worthy of pulling tape 
        across the finish line. 
        And then I found a poem of mine 
        that I had carefully written 
        by hand in the sixth grade, 
        and at the bottom of the page, 
        in India ink, beautifully apart 
        from the rest of the text, were the words The End. 
        And I realized children very often denote the end 
        because it is indeed a great achievement for them 
        to have written anything, and they are completely 
        unaware of the number of stories and poems that have 
        already been written; they know some, of course, 
        but have not yet found out the extent to which they 
        are not the only persons residing on the planet. 
        And so they sign their poems and stories like kings. 
        Which is a wonderful thing.</div>
