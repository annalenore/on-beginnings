    <div class="text">I have never, in my life, 
        read a poem that ended with 
        the words The End. 
        Why is that, I wonder. 
        I think perhaps the brevity 
        of poems compared to novels 
        makes one feel that there 
        has been no great sustention 
        of energy, no <a href=incongruent-text.html>marathon</a> worthy 
        of pulling tape across the finish line. 
        And then I found a poem of mine that 
        I had carefully written by hand in 
        the sixth grade, and at the bottom 
        of the page, in India ink,
        beautifully apart from the rest 
        of the text, were the words The End.
        And I realized children very often 
        denote the end because it is indeed 
        a great achievement for them to have 
        written anything, and they are 
        completely unaware of the number 
        of stories and poems that have already 
        been written; they know some, of course, 
        but have not yet found out the extent to 
        which they are not the only persons 
        residing on the planet. 
        And so they sign their poems and stories like kings. 
        Which is a wonderful thing.</div>
