    <div class="text">You might say a poem is a semicolon, 
        a living semicolon, what connects the first 
        line to the last, the act of keeping 
        together that whose nature is to fly apart. 
        Between the first and last lines there 
        exists—a poem—and if it were not for 
        the poem that intervenes, the first and 
        last lines of a poem would not speak to 
        each other.</div>
