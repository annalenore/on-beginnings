    <div class="text">Now here is something really interesting 
        (to me), something you can use 
        at a standing-up-only party 
        when everyone is tired of hearing 
        there are one million 
        three-thousand-two-hundred-ninety-five 
        words used by the Esimo for snow. 
        This is what Ezra Pound learned from Ernest Fenollosa: 
        Some languages are so constructed—English 
        among them—that we each only really speak 
        one sentence in our lifetime. 
        That sentence begins with your first words, 
        toddling around the kitchen, 
        and ends with your last words 
        right before you step into the limousine, 
        or in a nursing home, the night-duty attendant 
        vaguely on hand. Or, if you are blessed, 
        they are heard by someone who knows you and 
        loves you and will be sorry to hear the sentence end.</div>
