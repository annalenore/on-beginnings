    <div class="text">Everyone knows that if you query poets 
        about how their poems begin, 
        the answer is always the same: 
        a phrase, a line, a scrap of language, 
        a rhythm, an image, something seen, 
        heard, witnessed, or imagined. 
        And the lesson is always the same, 
        and young poets recognize this to be one 
        of the most important lessons they can learn: 
        if you have any idea for a poem, an exact grid of intent,
         you are on the wrong path, a dead-end alley, 
         at the top of a cliff you havenâ€™t even climbed. 
         This is a lesson that can only be learned 
         by trial and error.</div>
