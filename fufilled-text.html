    <div class="text">Barbara Henstein Smith, 
        in her book Poetic Closure: 
        A Study of How Poems End, 
        says this: 
        “Perhaps all we can say, 
        and even this may be too much, 
        is that varying degrees or states 
        of tension seem to be involved 
        in all our experiences, 
        and that the most gratifying 
        ones are those in which whatever 
        tensions are created are also released.
        Or, to use another familiar set of terms, 
        an experience is gratifying to the extent 
        that those expectations that are aroused 
        are also <a href=traced-text.html>fulfilled</a>.”</div>
