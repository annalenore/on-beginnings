    <div class="text">Paul Valéry, the French poet and 
        thinker, once said that no poem is ever 
        ended, that every poem is merely 
        abandoned. This saying is also 
        attributed to Stéphane Mallarmé, for 
        where quotations begin is in a cloud. 
        Paul Valéry also described his 
        perception of first lines so vividly, and 
        to my mind so accurately, that I have
        never forgotten it: the opening line of a 
        poem, he said, is like finding a fruit on 
        the ground, a piece of fallen fruit you 
        have never seen before, and the poet’s 
        task is to create the tre from which such 
        a fruit would fall.</div>
